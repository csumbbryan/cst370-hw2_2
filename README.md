# CST370-HW2_2_Java

Write a Java program for hw2_2 which checks if an input string is a palindrome or not. In the problem, a palindrome means an alphanumeric string which reads the same front to back. For the problem, you should ignore case in the alphanumeric input string. Also, you should ignore symbols such as !, @, #, etc. In other words, you should consider only English letters and numbers in the input string. For example, “Racecar”, “IdiddidI”, “78!Dontnod8@7” are all palindromes. But “CSUMBUSC” is not a palindrome.

Sample Run 0: Assume that the user typed the following word
Racecar

This is the correct output of your program.
TRUE


Sample Run 1: Assume that the user typed the following word
CSUMBUSC

This is the correct output of your program.

FALSE


Sample Run 2: Assume that the user typed the following word
78!Dontnod8@7

This is the correct output of your program.

TRUE
